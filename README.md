## Overview 📚

This project focuses on **letter recognition** using a custom-built **feedforward neural network**. It classifies binary images of letters **A**, **B**, and **C** using **NumPy** for computation and **Matplotlib** for visualizations. From scratch, the network implements forward propagation, **sigmoid activation**, and **custom backpropagation**, offering insights into the workings of neural networks.

---

## Key Features 🚀

- 🏗️ Built a **feedforward neural network** entirely from scratch using **NumPy**.
- 🔁 Implemented **custom backpropagation** and **sigmoid activation** without any ML libraries.
- 🧮 Trained on binary image datasets of **letters A, B, and C**.
- 📊 Tracked training **accuracy** over epochs to evaluate performance.
- 📉 Visualized model predictions and training results using **Matplotlib**.
